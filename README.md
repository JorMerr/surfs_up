## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to see a comparison between the average, minimum and maximum temperatures recorded at weather stations for the months of June and December. We then review key differences between the two months. Finally, we suggest further analysis and queries to complete in order to provide to board members sufficient relevant information to invest in our Surf and Ice Cream shop.
## Results
The dataset was reviewed for temperatures in the month of June and December for all years. The temperatures for June and December were then analyzed to summarize the temperature statistics for each month. One point of interest which may impact the overall analysis is that the total count of temperature observations for the month of June has 1700 datapoints, while the total count of temperature observations in December was 1517. This difference may be accounted for by some weather stations being offline, as yet unbuilt, or having a reduced quota of daily observations during the month of December. This analysis does not investigate the total count difference in each month.

### Key Differences Between June and December Temperatures
- The average temperature for the month of June is nearly 4 degrees higher than the average temperature for the month of December.
- While the maximum temperatures for both June and December are within standard deviation, June's maximum temperature is 2 degrees warmer than December's maximum temperature.
- The minimum temperature for the month of December is approximately 8 degrees cooler than the minimum temperature for the month of June.

## Summary
Analysis shows that the temperatures in June are statistically more likely to be warmer than in December, with a 3 degree difference in the average temperatures. 
## Additional Queries
Further review is recommended to determine optimal surfing conditions. It is recommended to query the precipitation values for the months of June and December and compare the results. It is also recommended to query the average temperatures reported by each weather station. The weather station which reports the most optimal conditions for surfing on average allows W. Avy and the board to narrow their search of location to establish the Surf and Ice Cream shop.
