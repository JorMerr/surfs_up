## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to see a comparison between the average, minimum and maximum temperatures recorded at weather stations for the months of June and December. We then review key differences between the two months. Finally, we suggest further analysis and queries to complete in order to provide to board members sufficient relevant information to invest in our Surf and Ice Cream shop.
